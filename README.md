# Replays Analyser
A C++ console program to analyze [Super Smash Flash 2](https://mcleodgaming.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Smash_Flash_2) (SSF2) replays statistically.

Currently exclusive to developers (runs through Visual Studio).

I use this program to analyze my autosaved replays: [SSF2 Replays](https://github.com/DavoDC/SSF2Replays).
