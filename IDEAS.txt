STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF SSF2 REPLAY FILES


Match class add as proper helper function


ADD TO STRING TO MATCH CLASS
- calls toString on each field!

- convert StringPairs to wrapper class like ReplayDate 
	- add ToString, 6chars of each
	- date = StringPairs(rawPcPairs) -> does all processing!
	- add internal function - add Pair(String, String) for direct, ez add, with removals

PRINT OUT STRINGIFIED OF each Match



STATISTICS:

SORT A LIST OF THE CLASS BY DATE
	- Need to implement comparable like in Java

Oldest date and MATCH =
Newest date and MATCH = 

Matches per year

% matches in each year
Average matches per year

Common players

Mentions of characters
e.g. 50% of replays involve Wario
